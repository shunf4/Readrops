        <title>Google Expands its Flutter Development Kit To Windows Apps</title>
        <link>
            https://developers.slashdot.org/story/20/09/23/1616231/google-expands-its-flutter-development-kit-to-windows-apps?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed

        <description>Google has announced that Flutter, its open source UI development kit for
            building cross-platform software from the same codebase, is finally available for
            Windows apps in alpha. From a report:For the world's leading desktop operating system
            with some 1 billion installations of Windows 10 alone, this has been a long time coming.
            Flutter's alpha incarnation was initially launched at Google's I/O developer conference
            back in 2017, before arriving in beta less than a year later. In its original guise,
            Flutter was designed for Android and iOS app development, but it has since expanded to
            cover the web, MacOS, and Linux, which are currently available in various alpha or beta
            iterations. Developers have had to consider unique platform-specific factors when
            designing for the desktop or mobile phones, such as different screen sizes and how
            people interact with their devices. On smartphones, people typically use touch and
            swipe-based gestures, while keyboards and mice are commonly used on PCs and laptops.
            This means Flutter has had to expand its support to cover the additional inputs.&lt;p&gt;&lt;div

        <title>Firefox Usage is Down 85% Despite Mozilla's Top Exec Pay Going Up 400%</title>

        <description>Software engineer Cal Paterson writes: Mozilla recently announced that they
            would be dismissing 250 people. That's a quarter of their workforce so there are some
            deep cuts to their work too. The victims include: the MDN docs (those are the web
            standards docs everyone likes better than w3schools), the Rust compiler and even some
            cuts to Firefox development. Like most people I want to see Mozilla do well but those
            three projects comprise pretty much what I think of as the whole point of Mozilla, so
            this news is a a big let down. The stated reason for the cuts is falling income. Mozilla
            largely relies on "royalties" for funding. In return for payment, Mozilla allows big
            technology companies to choose the default search engine in Firefox - the technology
            companies are ultimately paying to increase the number of searches Firefox users make
            with them. Mozilla haven't been particularly transparent about why these royalties are
            being reduced, except to blame the coronavirus. I'm sure the coronavirus is not a great
            help but I suspect the bigger problem is that Firefox's market share is now a tiny
            fraction of its previous size and so the royalties will be smaller too - fewer users, so
            fewer searches and therefore less money for Mozilla.

            The real problem is not the royalty cuts, though. Mozilla has already received more than
            enough money to set themselves up for financial independence. Mozilla received up to
            half a billion dollars a year (each year!) for many years. The real problem is that
            Mozilla didn't use that money to achieve financial independence and instead just spent
            it each year, doing the organisational equivalent of living hand-to-mouth. Despite their
            slightly contrived legal structure as a non-profit that owns a for-profit, Mozilla are
            an NGO just like any other. In this article I want to apply the traditional measures
            that are applied to other NGOs to Mozilla in order to show what's wrong. These three
            measures are: overheads, ethics and results.&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="share_submission"

        <title>Climate Disruption Is Now Locked In. The Next Moves Will Be Crucial.</title>

        <description>America is now under siege by climate change in ways that scientists have
            warned about for years. But there is a second part to their admonition: Decades of
            growing crisis are already locked into the global ecosystem and cannot be reversed. From
            a report: This means the kinds of cascading disasters occurring today -- drought in the
            West fueling historic wildfires that send smoke all the way to the East Coast, or
            parades of tropical storms lining up across the Atlantic to march destructively toward
            North America -- are no longer features of some dystopian future. They are the here and
            now, worsening for the next generation and perhaps longer, depending on humanity's
            willingness to take action. "I've been labeled an alarmist," said Peter Kalmus, a
            climate scientist in Los Angeles, where he and millions of others have inhaled
            dangerously high levels of smoke for weeks. "And I think it's a lot harder for people to
            say that I'm being alarmist now." Last month, before the skies over San Francisco turned
            a surreal orange, Death Valley reached 130 degrees Fahrenheit, the highest temperature
            ever measured on the planet. Dozens of people have perished from the heat in Phoenix,
            which in July suffered its hottest month on record, only to surpass that milestone in
            August.

            Conversations about climate change have broken into everyday life, to the top of the
            headlines and to center stage in the presidential campaign. The questions are profound
            and urgent. Can this be reversed? What can be done to minimize the looming dangers for
            the decades ahead? Will the destruction of recent weeks become a moment of reckoning, or
            just a blip in the news cycle? The Times spoke with two dozen climate experts, including
            scientists, economists, sociologists and policymakers, and their answers were by turns
            alarming, cynical and hopeful. "It's as if we've been smoking a pack of cigarettes a day
            for decades" and the world is now feeling the effects, said Katharine Hayhoe, a climate
            scientist at Texas Tech University. But, she said, "we're not dead yet." Their most
            sobering message was that the world still hasn't seen the worst of it. Gone is the
            climate of yesteryear, and there's no going back. The effects of climate change evident
            today are the results of choices that countries made decades ago to keep pumping
            heat-trapping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere at ever-increasing rates despite
            warnings from scientists about the price to be paid.&lt;p&gt;&lt;div

            prominent and baffling public art projects. Its digital display once told the time in
            its own unique way, counting the hours, minutes and seconds (and fractions thereof) to
            and from midnight. But for years observers who did not understand how it worked
            suggested that it was measuring the acres of rainforest destroyed each year, tracking
            the world population or even that it had something to do with pi. On Saturday Metronome
            adopted a new ecologically sensitive mission. From a report: Now, instead of measuring
            24-hour cycles, it is measuring what two artists, Gan Golan and Andrew Boyd, present as
            a critical window for action to prevent the effects of global warming from becoming
            irreversible. On Saturday at 3:20 p.m., messages including "The Earth has a deadline"
            began to appear on the display. Then numbers -- 7:103:15:40:07 -- showed up,
            representing the years, days, hours, minutes and seconds until that deadline. As a
            handful of supporters watched, the number -- which the artists said was based on
            calculations by the Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change in
            Berlin -- began ticking down, second by second.

            "This is our way to shout that number from the rooftops." Mr. Golan said just before the
            countdown began. "The world is literally counting on us." The Climate Clock, as the two
            artists call their project, will be displayed on the 14th Street building, One Union
            Square South, through Sept. 27, the end of Climate Week. The creators say their aim is
            to arrange for the clock to be permanently displayed, there or elsewhere. Mr. Golan said
            he came up with the idea to publicly illustrate the urgency of combating climate change
            about two years ago, shortly after his daughter was born. He asked Mr. Boyd, an activist
            from the Lower East Side, to work with him on the project.&lt;p&gt;&lt;div
