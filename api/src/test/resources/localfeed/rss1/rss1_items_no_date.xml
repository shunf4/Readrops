        <description>Google has announced that Flutter, its open source UI development kit for
            building cross-platform software from the same codebase, is finally available for
            Windows apps in alpha. From a report:For the world's leading desktop operating system
            with some 1 billion installations of Windows 10 alone, this has been a long time coming.
            Flutter's alpha incarnation was initially launched at Google's I/O developer conference
            back in 2017, before arriving in beta less than a year later. In its original guise,
            Flutter was designed for Android and iOS app development, but it has since expanded to
            cover the web, MacOS, and Linux, which are currently available in various alpha or beta
            iterations. Developers have had to consider unique platform-specific factors when
            designing for the desktop or mobile phones, such as different screen sizes and how
            people interact with their devices. On smartphones, people typically use touch and
            swipe-based gestures, while keyboards and mice are commonly used on PCs and laptops.
            This means Flutter has had to expand its support to cover the additional inputs.&lt;p&gt;&lt;div
